Introduction to Data Science course project 2023

Our data is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention/ and is uploaded to this repository. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees offered at a higher education institution. It includes demographic data, social-economic factors and academic performance information that can be used to analyze the possible predictors of student dropout and academic success. This dataset contains multiple disjoint databases consisting of relevant information available at the time of enrollment, such as application mode, marital status, course chosen and more.
