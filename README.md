# Students' dropout and academic success analysis
Introduction to Data Science course project 2023 by Hanna Mia Sooman and Johann Mattias Tamm

Many universities struggle with students dropping out and often the drop-out rates are influenced by different social, economic, and demographic factors. By understanding these factors, universities and higher education institutions could get more accurate reasoning behind students’ success or failure and then take proactive measures to improve overall retention rates.  
The main goals of this project are to: 
Identify at least five factors that seem to have the biggest effect on this dataset’s instances of low academic success and dropping out.
Train a model that achieves an 80% or higher accuracy of predicting dropouts.
